# A Non Intrusive Low Cost Arduino-based Three Phase Sensor Kit for Electric Power Measuring

## Abstract
This article presents a kit to collect data of electric loads using a device that measures single-phase data and and second device that measures the input of three-phase main power supply of a house.
To collect the data, we used current sensors based on an open magnetic core to measure the electromagnetic field induced by the current in the electric conducting wire in a non intrusive way.
In particular, each sensor from the three-phase device wraps/encloses each phase without alignment.
We conducted a data analysis for validation. Initially, we carried out a statistical analysis of the data on the three-phase device resulting an error of $9,2\%$ constituted by the noise of the sensors and Arduino, which required a calibration.
The calibration was made by software.
We present a method to calculate the neutral RMS without complex numbers using (Analysis of Variance) ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's multiple comparison test to assert the differences of measures among phases. We managed to validate the method using a measure reference.
Based on the proposed kit, several applications can be developed, for example, energy disaggregation and smart measure.
